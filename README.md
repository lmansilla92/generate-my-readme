# Generate My README

## Repository

In this repository you will find the application code to a README generator. The purpose of this application is to generate a README file using fs by getting the user input data from the inquirer prompts. A series of questions are asked after typing node index.js in the integrated terminal to gather the information that will be written to the README file. One of the prompts asks to pick a license and gives you a few options to pick from and will display the correspondoing badge of the license chosen to your file.
